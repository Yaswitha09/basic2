            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Yaswitha</strong>, an enthusiastic Electrical Engineering student currently in my third year at Prasad V. Potluri Siddhartha Institute of Technology. Alongside my major, I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
            <p>My academic journey has been a blend of both electrical engineering and computer science, allowing me to develop a diverse skill set. I am passionate about exploring the core concepts of electrical engineering while simultaneously delving into the exciting world of computer science.</p>
            <p>With interests spanning across both fields, I am eager to apply my knowledge to solve complex problems and innovate. My coursework and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in both hardware and software, preparing me for a dynamic career where I can leverage my interdisciplinary expertise.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, I am keen on taking on new challenges and collaborating with peers to enhance my learning and contribute meaningfully to the field. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I have worked on, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!</p>
